# ORION — Omnipotent Routing Intelligence for Operational Navigation (Preview)

> ⚠️ This is the **first functional module** of ORION — a broader intelligent assistant system. What you're reading is documentation for just **one puzzle piece** in development, not the complete ORION project.

## 🌟 Welcome to ORION

**ORION (Omnipotent Routing Intelligence for Operational Navigation)** is a modular, intelligent assistant framework designed to understand user intent and route commands to specialized modules — such as AI reasoning, weather APIs, music control, or system automation.

This document introduces the **first stage** of the system — the **Routing Module**, which translates raw human input into structured module commands.

🔧 Built with extensibility in mind, ORION will eventually combine:

* Natural language understanding
* Modular action routing
* Smart home, study, and productivity integrations
* Voice interface and memory context

You are currently looking at the routing core that makes this possible. As development progresses, more modules will integrate into this ecosystem.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Module

This routing module:

* Accepts **natural user input** (spoken or typed)
* Strips irrelevant filler words
* Decomposes complex instructions into clean, actionable module calls
* Returns a **Python list of \['MODULE', 'QUERY']** pairs, ready to be dispatched

---

🚀 **This is only the beginning.** ORION will grow into a full assistant system that thinks, remembers, and acts across domains.

Stay tuned! 🌌
